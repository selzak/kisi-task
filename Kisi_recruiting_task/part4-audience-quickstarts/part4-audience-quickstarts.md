# Audience Quick Starts

## Installer
Mount the legacy reader and Kisi Reader. Connect legacy reader wires (D0, D1, +, â€“) into the Kisi Wiegand Board set to **READER** mode. Connect Kisi Controller relay output to door strike. For dual-controller setups, set Wiegand Board to **CONTRL** mode and wire into the legacy controller.

## Kisi Admin
Add the legacy reader as a Wiegand input in the Kisi dashboard. Assign credentials to users and map doors to Kisi Controllers. For mixed setups with a legacy controller, ensure the Wiegand Board is in **CONTRL** mode so Kisi can pass validated signals through. Test credentials before rollout.

## Kisi End User
Simply use your card or phone by presenting it in front of the reader. Kisi checks your credential instantly. If approved, Kisi unlocks the door. No extra steps are required: you just tap as usual, and Kisi ensures secure, cloud-based access.
